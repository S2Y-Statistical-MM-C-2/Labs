Conduct one-sample \\(t\\)-test in R with the built-in function. Explore further the significance level and the power of a test. 1.1 Summary for testing the mean when sampling from a normal distribution with unknown variance (one-sample \\(t\\)-test) 1.2 Optional: RStudio Quickstart Guide This course assumes basic knowledge of R and RStudio. The starting point is opening RStudio by going to: Maths &amp; Stats Apps &gt; RStudio To access the data in this course, it is best to open and save a new script file to work in within RStudio and to set the working directory. This will enable you to save your R commands and comments on your work as you go through each of the examples. To open a new script go to: File &gt; New &gt; R script This will open a new screen for you to type into. Go to: File &gt; Save as and save the script file into your home directory. Now, start by setting the working directory in RStudio to the directory in which you have stored both the data and R script. One way of doing this is to go to: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location This will point RStudio towards this directory to enable us to use files within that directory. It is useful to annotate your script file using comments so that you know what has been done when you look at it in the future. Comments can be added to a script file by starting the line with a # symbol. 1.3 Credit where credit is due The labs in S2Y incorporate and adapt materials from: Ugarte, M. D., Militino, A.

The materials were converted into interactive labs on Hypothesis Testing using Bookdown and webexercises in Summer 2023 by summer project student, Megan Ruffle. "],["the-basic-premise-of-hypothsis-testing.html", "2 The Basic Premise of Hypothsis Testing 2.1 The 5 steps of Hypothesis Testing", " 2 The Basic Premise of Hypothsis Testing All hypothesis tests that we will look at in these labs will fit the same pattern: We want to decide if the observed data from our study provides evidence to reject a baseline assumption (a null hypothesis). For all tests, we will compare our observed data to an expected distribution from the null hypothesis. The values used in this comparison: The test will have a significance level and we find the critical value that corresponds to this to decide on a Rejection Region (shown in red on the graph below). This is the part of our distribution that we decide is unusual and could disprove our null hypothesis. We calculate a Standardised Test Statistic from our data and find its corresponding area on the distribution, the \\(p\\)-value, to be able to compare what we saw to the distribution (illustrated in blue on the graph below). How the Standardised Test Statistic compares to the rejection region, and hence how our \\(p\\)-value compares to the significance level, is what changes the conclusion of our hypothesis test. The graphical example above is a test that would assume normally distributed data and would result in failing to reject the null hypothesis. The red area is our rejection region. The blue area represents the probability of seeing our observed data assuming the null hypothesis is true (this probability is known as the \\(p\\)-value). The Standardised Test Statistic does not sit in the rejection region. As a result the blue area is greater than the red area meaning our data was not unusual compared to the distribution where the null hypothesis is true. 2.1 The 5 steps of Hypothesis Testing In the next few labs we will look through different scenarios where we might conduct a hypothesis test. In your textbook and lectures you have seen these tests broken into 5 steps. Often when undertaking hypothesis tests in R, we find the Standardised Test Statistic and \\(p\\)-value in one action such as when using t.test(). In the labs the 5 steps will therefore be arranged as follows: Hypotheses Set up the null and alternative hypotheses to answer your question Test Statistic Selection Choose your Test Statistic Hypothesis Test Calculations Find the Critical Value and Rejection Region from the distribution Calculate the Standardised Test Statistic from the observed data Find the \\(p\\)-value that corresponds to the Standardised Test Statistic Statistical Conclusion Comparing the observed value of the Standardised Test Statistic to the Rejection Region or Critical value Comparing the \\(p\\)-value to the significance level English Conclusion Giving the meaning of statistical conclusion in context of the question. (Note this is slightly different to the the wording in the textbook just for simplicity of grouping together all calculations in R within Step 3.) We shall consistently find the Rejection Region and then analyse our observed data to compare it to that region.

The data come from Hand et al. (1994, Data Set #6, Abrasion Loss) and are stored in the data frame Rubber of the MASS package. The abrasion loss is measured in grams/hour; the hardness, in degrees shore; and the tensile strength, in \\(kg/cm^2\\). Use the five-step procedure to test whether \\(\\mu &lt; 170\\) for abrasion loss (loss) with 95% confidence. To open this data file, type: library(MASS) RUBBER&lt;- Rubber This will assign the data to the object RUBBER. To view the data, type RUBBER into the script file and running that line by either placing the cursor on the line and pressing Ctrl and Enter, or by clicking on the Run button in the top-right corner of the script file. The data will then appear in the Console window below. A spreadsheet of the data can be viewed by typing: fix(RUBBER) but note that you will need to close this window before trying to excute any further commands. The spreadsheet can also be viewed by clicking on the RUBBER object in the Environment (top right of the screen). 3.1 Verifying normality To solve this problem, start by verifying the normality assumption of the data using exploratory data analysis (EDA()). library(PASWR) with(data = RUBBER, EDA(loss)) ## Size (n) Missing Minimum 1st Qu Mean Median TrMean 3rd Qu ## 30.000 0.000 32.000 113.250 175.433 165.000 173.536 220.500 ## Max Stdev Var SE Mean I.Q.R.

Now, proceed with the five-step procedure. 3.2 Step 1 - Hypotheses To test if mean abrasion loss is less than \\(170\\), the hypotheses are: \\[H_0 : \\mu = 170 \\quad \\text{verses} \\quad H_1 : \\mu &lt; 170\\] Learn More This is a one-tail test as as we want to know how different the loss is from a mean of 170 (specifically less than) rather than just if it is different which would give the two-tail hypotheses \\(H_0 : \\mu = 170\\) versus \\(H_1 : \\mu \\neq 170\\). 3.3 Step 2 - Choosing a Test Statistic The test statistic chosen is \\(\\bar{X}\\) because \\(E[\\bar{X}] = \\mu\\). xbar &lt;- mean(RUBBER$loss) xbar ## [1] 175.4333 The value of this test statistic is \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}x_i}{n} = 175.4333\\) Learn More We have this as our test statistic because we want to evaluate the mean value. We will determine the probability of obtaining that test statistic (sample mean) when the null hypothesis is true. We do this with standardisation and the probability is called the \\(p\\)-value which we will find soon. The standardised test statistic under the assumption that \\(H_0\\) is true is distributed \\(\\frac{\\bar{X}−\\mu_0}{S/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim t_{30-1}\\). 3.4 Step 3 - Hypothesis Test Calculations 3.4.1 Finding the Rejection Region Because the standardised test statistic is distributed \\(t_{29}\\) and \\(H_1\\) is a lower one-sided hypothesis, the rejection region is the \\(t_{obs} \\leq t_{0.05; 29}\\). From the statistical tables, the \\(t\\)-value that corresponds to our significance level (critical value) is \\(t_{0.05; 29} = −1.6991\\). Remember this is negative because we are discussing the lower tail of the \\(t\\)-distribution. This same \\(t\\)-value can be found using R: RR &lt;- qt(0.05, df = 29) RR ## [1] -1.699127 Graphically the rejection region is as follows: Learn More The rejection region is the area in which we would reject our null hypothesis. The critical value is the \\(t\\)-value that corresponds to \\(p=0.05\\), and hence is the top limit of our rejection region. The probability of observing our test statistic (sample mean) or more extreme values under the null hypothesis is the \\(p\\)-value. To reject the null hypothesis in this case we need our standardisd test statistic to be less than our critical value and hence our \\(p\\)-value &lt; 0.05 3.4.2 Finding the standardised test statistic and \\(p\\)-value The value of the standardised test statistic is given by \\(\\frac{\\bar{X}−\\mu_0}{S/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{175.4333−170}{S/\\sqrt{n}}\\). We can obtain \\(S\\) and \\(n\\) in R by using: S &lt;- sd(RUBBER$loss) S ## [1] 88.08526 n &lt;- length(RUBBER$loss) n ## [1] 30 This gives our standardised test statistic \\(t_{obs}=\\frac{\\bar{X}−\\mu_0}{S/\\sqrt{n}} = 0.3378\\): sta.test.stat &lt;- (175.4333-170)/(S/sqrt(n)) sta.test.stat ## [1] 0.3378478 The \\(p\\)-value that corresponds to our standardised test statistic, \\(P(t_{29} \\leq 0.3378)\\) is: pvalue &lt;- pt(0.3378478, df=29) pvalue ## [1] 0.6310443 OR The standardised test statistic can be found using: Test &lt;- t.test(RUBBER$loss, mu = 170, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) Test ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: RUBBER$loss ## t = 0.33785, df = 29, p-value = 0.631 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is less than 170 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -Inf 202.7589 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 175.4333 Learn More Graphically this could be shown: Our standardised test statistic is greater than the critical value and outside the rejection region. The \\(p\\)-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\). 3.5 Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion To draw conclusions we need to consider the rejection region: Is the value of standardised test statistic inside the rejection region? Is the \\(p\\)-value smaller than 0.05? QUESTION: Do we reject the null hypothesis? Solution I. From the rejection region, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\) because the standardised test statistic is greater than the critical value and hence outside the rejection region i.e. \\(t_{obs} = 0.3378 &gt; -1.6991\\). OR From the \\(p\\)-value, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\) because the \\(p\\)-value is \\(0.631 &gt; 0.05\\). Whichever method we use, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). 3.6 Step 5 - English Conclusion What does the above statistical conclusion mean for the data and the purpose of the test? Is there statistical evidence to suggest a mean less than 170? QUESTION: Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test? There is sufficient evidence to suggest the mean abrasion loss is less than 170. We cannot conclude if there is sufficient evidence to suggest the mean abrasion loss is less than 170. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest the mean abrasion loss is less than 170. There is sufficient evidence to suggest the mean abrasion loss is greater than 170.

If revenues are less than €2 million per day, the company will go bankrupt. Likewise, revenues greater than €2 million per day cannot be handled without increasing staff. Assume that revenues follow a normal distribution with \\(\\sigma =\\) €0.5 million and a mean of \\(\\mu\\). To find out more about their revenue they want to perform a hypothesis test \\(H_0 : \\mu = 2\\) versus \\(H_1 : \\mu \\neq 2\\). To understand more about how hypothesis tests work, three scenarios will be presented to show how the power of a test can change: varying \\(\\mu\\), varying significance level and varying sample size.
