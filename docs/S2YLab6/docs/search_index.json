Recall the model we created in Lab 4, where we try to predict the hydrostatic fat measurement of a wrestler from abomnimal fat and tricep fat measurements. library(PASWR) HSWRESTLER &lt;- HSwrestler Model1 &lt;- lm(HWFAT ~ ABS + TRICEPS, data = HSWRESTLER) We apply the summary function, which gives the following output: summary(Model1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = HWFAT ~ ABS + TRICEPS, data = HSWRESTLER) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -6.5558 -2.2550 -0.5245 2.3365 9.4957 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 2.05904 0.65219 3.157 0.0023 ** ## ABS 0.33708 0.06415 5.255 1.34e-06 *** ## TRICEPS 0.50430 0.09920 5.084 2.64e-06 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 3.061 on 75 degrees of freedom ## Multiple R-squared: 0.8832, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8801 ## F-statistic: 283.6 on 2 and 75 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 The above R output displays a few elements, which were briefly explained below. Call: This shows the formula that was used in the regression model. Residuals: This lists the five-number summary of the residuals from the regression model. Coefficients: This shows a summary of estimated coefficients of the regression model. Within this section the column headers are: Estimate: The estimated parameter. These can be used to write down the fitted regression model. Std. Error: This is the estimated standard error of the parameter estimate. t value: This is the \\(t\\)-statistic for the parameter, calculated as Estimate / Std. Error. Pr(&gt;|t|): This is the \\(p\\)-value that corresponds to the \\(t\\)-statistic, i.e. \\(2\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X&gt;|t|)\\) for \\(X \\sim t(n-p)\\), where \\(t\\) is the t value computed above, \\(n\\) is the sample size, and \\(p\\) is the number of parameters. Significance codes: These codes in asterisks are appended to the \\(p\\)-values in regression analysis results. They provide a quick indication of the level of significance of the predictors in the model. The most commonly used significance levels and their corresponding codes are: significance code p-value *** &lt; 0.001 ** 0.001 - 0.01 * 0.01 - 0.05 . 0.05 - 0.1 â‰¥ 0.1 Residual standard error: This is the square root of mean squared error (MSE), where \\(MSE=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i^2}{n-p}\\) is calculated as the sum of squared residuals divided by the degrees of freedom in the model. The remaining terms, Multiple R-squared, Adjusted R-squared and F-statistic, will be explained in subsequent labs. Here we can look at the estimates of the model coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}_k\\), which are both positive, indicating both Abs and Tri have a positive relationship with Hydrostatic fat. We can also state that both Abdominal Fat and Tricep Fat measurements are significant in predicting the Hydrostatic fat measurement to a significance level of \\(\\approx 0\\) by looking at the \\(p\\)-values associated with the \\(t\\)-tests.
