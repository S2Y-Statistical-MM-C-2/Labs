# Welcome to Lab 2

Intended Learning Outcomes:

1. Complete a two-sample t-test for the difference in the means assuming unequal variances in R with a step-by-step guide.
2. Complete a paired t-test for the difference in the means in R with a step-by-step guide.
3. Complete a paired hypothesis test for the difference in the means in R by yourself.

## Credit where credit is due

The labs in S2 incorporate and adapt materials from:

Ugarte, M. D., Militino, A. F., & Arnholt, A. T. (2008). [Probability and Statistics with R](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/gla/detail.action?docID=5338596). CRC press.

The materials were converted into interactive labs on Hypothesis Testing using `Bookdown` and `webexercises` in Summer 2023 by summer project student, Megan Ruffle.
