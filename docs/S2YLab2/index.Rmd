# Welcome to Lab 2

Intended Learning Outcomes:

1. Conduct a Welch test for the difference in the means in `R` with a step-by-step guide.
2. Conduct a paired $t$-test for the difference in the means in R with a step-by-step guide.
3. Conduct a paired $t$-test test for the difference in the means with the built-in function.
