Sixty 18-cubic-foot refrigerators were randomly selected from the company’s warehouse. The first 30 had their motors modified while the last 30 were left intact. The energy consumption (kilowatts) for a 24-hour period for each refrigerator was recorded and stored in the data frame REFRIGERATOR from the PASWR2 package. Question of interest: Is there evidence that the design modification reduces the refrigerators’ average energy consumption? Reminder of how to access data Install or load the package and then save the data to your environment. E.g: library(PASWR2) REFRIGERATOR &lt;- REFRIGERATOR 2.1 Verifying normality To solve this problem, start by verifying the reasonableness of the normality assumption. We can do this with ggplot(). ggplot(data = REFRIGERATOR, aes(x = group, y = kilowatts, fill = group)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() ggplot(data = REFRIGERATOR, aes(sample = kilowatts, color = group)) + ggtitle(&quot;Normal Q-Q Plot&quot;) + stat_qq() + theme_bw() The side-by-side boxplots and normal quantile-quantile plots suggest it is reasonable to assume the energy consumption for both models follows a normal distribution. Now, proceed with the five-step procedure. 2.2 Step 1 - Hypotheses Hypotheses — Since the problem wants to test to see if the mean energy consumption for modified refrigerators is less than the mean energy consumption for original refrigerators, use a lower one-sided alternative hypothesis. \\[H_0 : \\mu_{modified} - \\mu_{original} = 0 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_1 : \\mu_{modified} - \\mu_{original} &lt; 0\\] Learn More This is a one-tail test as as we want to know if the difference between the means is less than 0 rather looking to observe any difference which would give a two-tail hypotheses \\(H_0 : \\mu_{modified} - \\mu_{original} = 0\\) versus \\(H_1 : \\mu_{modified} - \\mu_{original} \\neq 0\\). 2.3 Step 2 - Choosing a Test Statistic The test statistic chosen is \\(\\bar{X}−\\bar{Y}\\) because \\(E[\\bar{X}−\\bar{Y}] = \\mu_X − \\mu_Y\\). Learn More We have this as our test statistic because we want to evaluate the expected difference between the means. We will determine the probability of obtaining that test statistic when the null hypothesis is true. We do this with standardisation and the probability is called the \\(p\\)-value which we will find soon. Means &lt;- with(data = REFRIGERATOR, tapply(kilowatts, group, mean)) Means ## modified original ## 1.535800 1.760067 The value of this test statistic is \\(1.5358 − 1.7601 = −0.2243\\). The standardised test statistic under the assumption that \\(H_0\\) is true and its approximate distribution are: \\[ \\frac{\\left[ (\\bar{X}-\\bar{Y}) - \\delta_0 \\right]}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{S^2_X}{n_X}+\\frac{S^2_Y}{n_Y} \\right)} }\\quad \\dot{\\sim} \\quad t_\\nu. \\] This is what will be used to complete the test. 2.4 Step 3 - Hypothesis Test Calculations 2.4.1 Finding your Rejection Region The degrees of freedom for this test are: \\[ \\nu = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{s^2_X}{n_X} + \\frac{s^2_Y}{n_Y} \\right)^2}{\\frac{s^2_X/n_X}{n_X-1} + \\frac{s^2_Y/n_Y}{n_Y-1}} = 54.7888 \\] Because the standardised test statistic is distributed \\(t_\\nu\\) and \\(H_1\\) is a lower one-sided hypothesis, the rejection region is the \\(t_{obs} &lt; t_{0.05; 54.7888}\\). From the statistical tables, the \\(t\\)-value that corresponds to our significance level (critical value) is \\(t_{0.05; 54.7888} = -1.6731\\). Remember this is negative because we are discussing the lower tail of the \\(t\\)-distribution. Remember this same \\(t\\)-value can be found using the R function qt(0.05, 54.7888). This gives us the critical value and the significance level which make up the rejection region (what we will compare our result to). Remember sketching or graphing this might help. Rejection Regions The rejection region is the area in which we would reject our null hypothesis. The critical value is the \\(t\\) value that corresponds to the significance level of 0.05, and hence is the top limit of our rejection region. The probability of observing our test statistic (difference in sample means) or more extreme values under the null hypothesis is the \\(p\\)-value. To reject a null hypothesis in this case we need our standardisd test statistic to be less than our critical value and hence our \\(p\\)-value &lt; 0.05. 2.4.2 Finding your standardised test statistic and \\(p\\)-value Our standardised test statistic \\(=\\frac{\\bar{x}−\\bar{y}-\\delta_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_X}{n_X}+\\frac{s^2_Y}{n_Y} }} = -2.5128\\). We should use R to find the corresponding \\(p\\)-value. The test we are actually running here is a Welch test as we are comparing two independent samples from normal distributions without assuming they have equal variances. In R this is automatically chosen within the t.test() function: TR &lt;- t.test(kilowatts ~ group, data = REFRIGERATOR, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) TR ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: kilowatts by group ## t = -2.5128, df = 54.789, p-value = 0.007475 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group modified and group original is less than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -Inf -0.07494116 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group modified mean in group original ## 1.535800 1.760067 This gives again \\(t = -2.5128\\) and the \\(p\\)-value as 0.0075. Learn More Last week we saw this graphically.You may want to revisit if you need help make a visual comparison between the value of test statistic and the rejection region we found above. 2.5 Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion To draw our conclusions we need to consider our rejection region. Remember this is at the lower end of the t-distribtion for this one-sided test. Is our standardised test statistic inside the rejection region? Is our \\(p\\)-value smaller than 0.05? QUESTION: Do we reject our null hypothesis? Solution I. From the rejection region, we reject \\(H_0\\) because the standardised test statistic is less than the critical value and hence in the rejection region i.e. \\(t_{obs} = -2.5128 &lt; -1.6731\\). OR From the \\(p\\)-value, we reject \\(H_0\\) because the \\(p\\)-value \\(0.0075 &lt; 0.05\\). Whichever method we use, we reject \\(H_0\\). 2.6 Step 5 - English Conclusion What does the previous statistical conclusion mean for the data and the purpose of the test? Is there statistical evidence to suggest the mean for modified refrigerators is less than of original refrigerators? QUESTION: Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test? There is not enough evidence to suggest the average energy consumption for modified refrigerators is less than the average energy consumption for unmodified (original) refrigerators. There is evidence to suggest the average energy consumption for modified refrigerators is greater than the average energy consumption for unmodified (original) refrigerators. There is evidence to suggest the average energy consumption for modified refrigerators is less than the average energy consumption for unmodified (original) refrigerators. We cannot conclude if there is sufficient evidence to suggest the average energy consumption for modified refrigerators is less than the average energy consumption for unmodified (original) refrigerators.

Now, proceed with the five-step procedure. 3.2 Step 1 - Hypotheses Hypotheses — To test the average difference (speed1 - speed2) in recorded speeds, the hypotheses are \\[H_0 : \\mu_D = 0 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_1 : \\mu_D &gt; 0\\] Notation We use \\(\\mu_D\\) here as this is paired data so every point from speed2 can be subtracted from a matching point in speed1. 3.3 Step 2 - Choosing a Test Statistic The test statistic chosen is \\(\\bar{D}\\) because \\(E[\\bar{D}] = \\mu_D\\). dbar &lt;- mean(Diff) dbar ## [1] -1.329167 The value of this test statistic is \\(\\bar{d} = −1.3292\\).

Remember this is at the upper end of the t-distribtion for this one-sided test. Is our standardised test statistic inside the rejection region? Is our \\(p\\)-value smaller than 0.05? Sketch the test and results on the distribution if it helps you. QUESTION: Do we reject our null hypothesis? Solution I. From the rejection region, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\) because the standardised test statistic is less than the critical value and hence in the rejection region i.e. \\(t_{obs} = -0.2804 &lt; 1.3634\\).

Whichever method we use, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). 3.6 Step 5 - English Conclusion What does the previous statistical conclusion mean for the data and the purpose of the test? Is there statistical evidence to suggest the the mean difference between tennis ball speeds is greater than zero? QUESTION: Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test? There is not sufficient evidence to suggest there is a difference between the mean speeds. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest the mean difference between speeds is greater than zero. There is sufficient evidence to suggest the mean difference between speeds is greater than zero.

Unfortunately, on June 25, 1990, a spherical aberration was discovered in Hubble’s primary mirror. To correct this, astronauts had to work in space. To prepare for the mission, two teams of astronauts practiced making repairs under simulated space conditions. Each team of astronauts went through 15 identical scenarios. The times to complete each scenario were recorded in days. The data are stored in the data frame HUBBLE in thr PASWR2 package. We will aim to answer the questions: Is one team better than the other?
