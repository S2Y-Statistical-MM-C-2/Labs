# Example 3: Dependent children

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(PASWR2)
DEPEND <- DEPEND
```

The data frame *DEPEND* from the `PASWR2` package shows the number of dependent children (number) for 50 families (count). Use a goodness-of-fit test to see if a Poisson
distribution with $\lambda$ = 2 can reasonably be used to model the number of dependent children. The significance level is 5%. 

## Step 1: construct the observed and expected values for different categories

To start with, we look at the data to determine how many categories should be created.

```{r}
FT <- xtabs(~number, data = DEPEND)
FT
```

Based on the frequency table for the number of dependent children, the cells with four, five, and six children are combined into a single cell for four or more children. After the merge, we get the observed number of children for five categories as follows:
```{r}
obs <- c(9, 13, 13, 7, 8)
```


Under the null hypothesis that $F_0(x)$ is a Poisson distribution with $\lambda=2$, the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more dependent children are computed with R as follows:

```{r}
null.p <- c(dpois(0, 2), dpois(1, 2), dpois(2, 2),
            dpois(3, 2), ppois(3, 2, lower = FALSE))
null.p
```

Since there were a total of $n = 50$ families, the expected number of dependent children for the five categories is simply $50 \times$`null.p`. 

```{r}
EX <- 50*null.p
EX
```

We are now ready to conduct the hypothesis test. 

## Step 1 - Hypotheses

The null and alternative hypotheses for using the chi-square
goodness-of-fit test to test the hypothesis that the number of dependent children follows a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$ are: 
\[
\begin{split}
&H_0: F_X(x) = F_0(x) \sim Pois(\lambda = 2.5) \text{ for all } x \textit{ versus}\\
&H_1: F_X(x) \neq F_0(x) \text{ for some }x.
\end{split}\]

## Step 2 - Choosing a Test Statistic

The test statistic chosen is $\chi^2_\text{obs} = \sum_{k=1}^5 \frac{(O_k-E_k)^2}{E_k}$.

## Step 3 - Rejection Region Calculations

Reject $H_0$ if $\chi^2_\text{obs} > \chi^2_{1-\alpha;k-1}$, where $k$ denotes the number of categories. 

**QUESTION**:

Find the value of the test statistic. $\chi^2_\text{obs}$=`r fitb(c(1.33502,1.335,1.34))`

Find the critical value. $\chi^2_{1-\alpha;k-1}$=`r fitb(c(9.487729,9.48773,9.4877,9.488,9.49))`

Find the $p$-value. $p$-value=`r fitb(c(0.8554064,0.855406,0.85541,0.8554,0.855,0.856))`

`r hide("Solution")`

Using R, we can find the value of test statistic, the critical value, and $p$-value ($P(\chi^2_4 \geq \chi^2_\text{obs})$) as follows.
```{r}
chi.obs <- sum((obs - EX)^2/EX) #value of the test statistic
chi.obs 

qchisq(0.95, 4) #critical value

pchisq(chi.obs, 4, lower=FALSE) #p-value
chisq.test(x=obs, p=null.p)
```
`r unhide()`

We can find the value of test statistic and $p$-value by using the R function `chisq.test`.

```{r}
chisq.test(x=obs, p=null.p)
```

In the output, `X-squared` gives the value of test statistic, `df` is the degrees of freedom for this $\chi^2$ distribution, and `p-value` gives the $p$-value. 

## Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion

Do we reject the null hypothesis?

`r longmcq(c("Yes", answer ="No"))`

`r hide("Solution")`
I. Since $\chi^2_\text{obs}=1.335$ is not greater than $\chi^2_{0.95;4}= 9.4877$, fail to reject $H_0$.

OR 

II. Since $p$-value$=0.8554 > 0.05$, fail to reject $H_0$.   
`r unhide()`

## Step 5 - English Conclusion

Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test?

1. There is evidence to suggest that the true **cdf** equals the Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$ for all $x$.
2. There is evidence to suggest that the true **cdf** equals the Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$ for at least one $x$.
3. There is no evidence to suggest that the true **cdf** does not equal the Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$ for at least one $x$.
4. There is no evidence to suggest that the true **cdf** does not equal the Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$ for all $x$.

`r longmcq(c("1","2",answer="3","4"))`
