# Example 4: Dependent children

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(PASWR2)
DEPEND <- DEPEND
```

The data frame *DEPEND* from the `PASWR2` package shows the number of dependent children (number) for 50 families (count). Use a goodness-of-fit test to see if a Poisson
distribution with $\lambda$ = 2 can reasonably be used to model the number of dependent children. The significance level is 5%. 

## Step 1: construct the observed and expected values for different categories

To start with, we look at the data to determine how many categories should be created.

```{r}
FT <- xtabs(~number, data = DEPEND)
FT
```

Based on the frequency table for the number of dependent children, the cells with four, five, and six children are combined into a single cell for four or more children. After the merge, we get the observed number of children for five categories as follows:
```{r}
obs <- c(9, 13, 13, 7, 8)
```


Under the null hypothesis that $F_0(x)$ is a Poisson distribution with $\lambda=2$, the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more dependent children are computed with R as follows:

```{r}
null.p <- c(dpois(0, 2), dpois(1, 2), dpois(2, 2),
            dpois(3, 2), ppois(3, 2, lower = FALSE))
null.p
```

Since there were a total of $n = 50$ families, the expected number of dependent children for the five categories is simply $50 \times$`null.p`. 

```{r}
EX <- 50*null.p
EX
```

We are now ready to conduct the hypothesis test. 

## Step 1 - Hypotheses

The null and alternative hypotheses for using the chi-square
goodness-of-fit test to test the hypothesis that the number of dependent children follows a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$ are: 
\[
\begin{split}
&H_0: F_X(x) = F_0(x) \sim Pois(\lambda = 2.5) \text{ for all } x \textit{ versus}\\
&H_1: F_X(x) \neq F_0(x) \text{ for some }x.
\end{split}\]

## Step 2 - Choosing a Test Statistic

The test statistic chosen is $\chi^2_\text{obs} = \sum_{k=1}^5 \frac{(O_k-E_k)^2}{E_k}$.

## Step 3 - Rejection Region Calculations

Reject $H_0$ if $\chi^2_\text{obs} > \chi^2_{1-\alpha;k-1} = \chi^2_{0.95;4}$; $k$ denotes the number of categories. 

Using R, we can find the value of test statistic and the critical value as follows.
```{r}
chi.obs <- sum((obs - EX)^2/EX) #value of the test statistic
chi.obs 

qchisq(0.95,4)
```

## Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion
