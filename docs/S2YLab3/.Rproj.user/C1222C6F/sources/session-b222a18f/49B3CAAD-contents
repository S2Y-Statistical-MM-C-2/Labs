# Welcome to Lab 3

Intended Learning Outcomes:

1. Conduct a hypothesis test for the population variance in `R` with a step-by-step guide.
2. Conduct a hypothesis test for the population proportion in `R` with a step-by-step guide.
2. Conduct a goodness-of-fit test in `R` with a step-by-step guide.

## A summary of the type of the hypothesis test and R commands used today

**Test for population variance**

<br>

![](Images/ftest.png)
The $F$-test can be implemented in R by using `var.test`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
var.test(x, y, ratio = 1,
         alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
         conf.level = 0.95)
```

* `ratio`: the hypothesised ratio of the population variances of $X$ and $Y$, i.e.  $\frac{\sigma_X^2}{\sigma_Y^2}$ under $H_0$
* `alternative`: the type of alternative hypothesis, where `two.sided` corresponds to $\sigma_X^2 \neq \sigma_Y^2$, `greater` corresponds to $\sigma_X^2 > \sigma_Y^2$, and `less` corresponds to $\sigma_X^2 < \sigma_Y^2$.
* `conf.level`: confidence level, which equals to $1-\alpha$ (significance level).

**Test for population proportions**

![](Images/binom.png)
The exact Binomial test can be implemented in R by using `binom.test`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
binom.test(x, n, p = 0.5,
           alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
           conf.level = 0.95)
```

* `x`: number of successes
* `n`: number of trials
* `p`: hypothesized probability of success, i.e. $\pi$ under $H_0$
* `alternative` and `conf.level`: same as explained in the `var.test` function.

Testing the proportion of successes in a Binomial experiment with normal approximation can be performed by using `prop.test`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
prop.test(x, n, p = NULL,
          alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
          conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)
```

All arguments are the same as in the `binom.test()` function. 

**Goodness-of-fit test**

The test criterion for testing $H_0: F_X(x) = F_0(x)$ for all $x$ against the alternative $H_1: F_X(x) \neq F_0(x)$ for some $x$ when the null hypothesis is completely specified is
\[\chi^2_\text{obs} = \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{(O_k-E_k)^2}{E_k},\]
where $K$ is the total number of categories.

For large $n$, provided all expected categories are at least 5, $\chi^2_\text{obs}$ is distributed approximately $\chi^2_{K-1}$.

The test can be performed by using `chisq.test`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.test(x, p)
```

* `x`: a vector of observed counts in each category
* `p`: a vector of probabilities for the observations falling into each category
