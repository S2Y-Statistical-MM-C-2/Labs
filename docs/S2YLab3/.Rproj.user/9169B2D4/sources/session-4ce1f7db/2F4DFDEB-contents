# Example 1 - Vitoria Apartment Costs

An apartment appraiser in Vitoria, Spain, feels confident in his appraisals of \(90m^2\) or larger pisos (apartments) provided his variability is less than \(60,000^2\text{€}^2\). 

Due to constant movement in the housing market, the regional housing authority suspects the appraiser’s variability may be greater than \(60,000^2\text{€}^2\). 

Is there evidence to support the suspicions of the regional housing authority?

*Test the appropriate hypothesis at the 5% significance level*

The appraised values of apartments in Vitoria are stored in the variable totalprice of the *VIT2005* data frame in the `PASWR2` package. 

`r hide("Reminder of how to access data")` 
Install or libraray() the package and then save the data to your environment. E.g:
`library(PASWR2)` 
`VIT2005 <- VIT2005`
`r unhide()`


## Verifying normality

To solve this problem, start by sectioning out the data we are interested in and then verify the reasonableness of the normality assumption.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE} 
Greater90 <- subset(x = VIT2005, subset = area >= 90)
with(data = Greater90, eda(totalprice))
n <- dim(Greater90)[1]
n
```
The results from applying `eda()`, suggest the appraised price for \(90m^2\) or larger pisos follows a normal distribution. Now, continue with the five-step procedure.

## **Step 1 - Hypotheses**

Hypotheses — The null and alternative hypotheses to test whether the price for \(90m^2\) or larger pisos variability is greater than \(60,000^2\text{€}^2\), are

$$H_0 : \sigma^2 = 60,000^2 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1 : \sigma^2 > 60,000^2 \neq 0$$


`r hide("Learn More")` 
This is a one-tail test as as we want to know if the variability in price of pisos that are \(90m^2\) is in fact \(60,000^2\text{€}^2\) or if it is greater than that. Two-tailed would test ofr any difference from \(60,000^2\text{€}^2\) not just greater than.
`r unhide()`



## **Step 2 - Test Statistic**

The test statistic chosen is \(\textrm{S}^2\) because \(E[\textrm{S}^2] = \sigma^2\).


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE} 
TS <- var(Greater90$totalprice)
TS
```

The value of this test statistic is \(s^2=3822980710\). 

The standardized test statistic under the assumption that \(H_0\) is true and its approximate distribution are:


$$ \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2_0}\quad \sim \quad \chi^2_{n-1}$$
This is what will be used to complete the test.


## **Step 3 - Hypothesis Test Calculations**

### Finding your Rejection Region

In this dataset, n = 94 so the standardized test statistic is distributed \(\chi^2_{94}\) and \(H_1\) is a upper one-sided hypothesis, the rejection region is the \(\chi^2_{obs} > \chi^2_{0.95;93}\)

Using R code or the statistical tables, the t-value that corresponds to our significance level (critical value) is \( \chi^2_{0.95;93} = 116.511\).

This can be found using the R function:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

RR <- qchisq(0.95, n-1)
RR
```

This gives us the critical value and the significance level which make up the rejection region (what we will compare our result to).
Remember sketching or graphing the chi-sqared distribution and regions might help.

`r hide("Rejection Regions")` 
The rejection region is the area in which we would reject our null hypothesis.
The critical value is the t value that corresponds to p = 0.05, and hence is the top limit of our rejection region.

The probability of observing our test statistic (our sample mean) under the null hypothesis is the p-value.

To reject a null-hypothesis in this case we need our standardisd test statistic to be greater than our critical value and hence our p-value < 0.05
`r unhide()`

### Finding your standardised test statistic and p-value

Our standardised test statistic \(\chi^2_{obs}\) = \(\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2_0} = \frac{(94-1)*3822980710}{60,000^2} = 98.7603\)

```{r}
STS <- (n - 1)*TS/60000^2
STS
```

We should use r to find the corresponding p-value \(\mathrm{P}(\chi^2_{93} \geq 98.7603)\).


``` {r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
pvalue <- pchisq(STS, n-1, lower = FALSE)
pvalue
```

This gives our Standardised Test Statistic as 98.7603 and the p-value \(\mathrm{P}(\chi^2_{93} \geq 98.7603) = 0.3218\).



`r hide("Learn More")` 
You may want to sketch or plot this test graphically if you need help making a visual comparison between this (our data) and the rejection region we found above.
`r unhide()`

98.7603 is less than 116.511 and our p-value 0.3218 is therefore greater than \(\alpha = 0.05\).


## **Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion**

To draw our conclusions we need to consider our rejection region.
*Remember this is at the upper end of the t-distribtion for this one-sided test.*

Is our standardised test statistic inside the rejection region? 

Is our p-value smaller than 0.05?


**QUESTION**: Do we reject our null hypothesis?

`r hide()`

I. From the rejection region, we fail to reject \(H_0\) because the standardised test statistic is less than the critical value and hence is not in the rejection region i.e \(\chi^2_{obs} = 98.7603 < 116.511\).

OR

II. From the p-value, we fail to reject \(H_0\) because the p-value\( 0.3218 > 0.05\).


Whichever method we use, we fail to reject \(H_0\).

`r unhide()`

## **Step 5 - English Conclusion**

What does our statistical conclusion mean for the data and the purpose of the test? 

Is there statistical evidence to suggest the variance for
the appraised price of \(90m^2\) or larger pisos is greater than \(60,000^2\text{€}^2\)?

**QUESTION**: Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcq <- c("There is evidence to suggest the variance for the appraised price of 90 meteres squared or larger pisos is greater than 3.6 billion Euros squared.", 
answer ="There is insufficient evidence to suggest the variance for the appraised price of 90 meteres squared or larger pisos is greater than 3.6 billion Euros squared.", "There is sufficient evidence to suggest the variance for the appraised price of 90 meteres squared or larger pisos is less than 3.6 billion Euros squared.", 
"We cannot conclude if there is sufficient evidence to suggest the variance for the appraised price of 90 meteres squared or larger pisos is greater than 3.6 billion Euros squared.")
```
`r longmcq(mcq)`
