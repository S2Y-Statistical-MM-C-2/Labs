# Welcome to Lab 3

Intended Learning Outcomes:

1. Complete a hypothesis test for the variance in R with a step-by-step guide.
2. Complete a two-sample  hypothesis test for the difference in variances in R with a step-by-step guide.
3. Complete Assessment Problem 1 and Assessment Problem 2 in R by yourself.

## Credit where credit is due

The labs in S2 incorporate and adapt materials from:

Ugarte, M. D., Militino, A. F., & Arnholt, A. T. (2008). [Probability and Statistics with R](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/gla/detail.action?docID=5338596). CRC press.

The materials were converted into interactive labs on Hypothesis Testing using `Bookdown` and `webexercises` in Summer 2023 by summer project student, Megan Ruffle.
