A medical researcher wishes to compare the average recovery times of patients treated with two different antiviral drugs. Previous large-scale clinical studies have established that the population standard deviations may be taken as known, with $\sigma_A = 4$ days and $\sigma_B = 5$ days. Independent random samples are taken: 40 patients treated with Drug A and 50 patients treated with Drug B. The sample mean recovery times are
\[
\bar{X}_A = 18.2 \text{ days}, \qquad \bar{X}_B = 16.9 \text{ days}.
\]

(a) Assume that recovery times in both populations are normally distributed. Using a 5% significance level, test whether the mean recovery time for patients treated with Drug A differs from that of patients treated with Drug B.

(b) Calculate the power of the test in (a) if the true difference in means is $\mu_A - \mu_B = 2$ days.
