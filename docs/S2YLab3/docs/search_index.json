Conduct a hypothesis test for the population proportion in R with a step-by-step guide. Conduct a goodness-of-fit test in R with a step-by-step guide. 1.1 A summary of the type of the hypothesis test and R commands used today Test for population variance The \\(F\\)-test can be implemented in R by using var.test: var.test(x, y, ratio = 1, alternative = c(&quot;two.sided&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;), conf.level = 0.95) ratio: the hypothesised ratio of the population variances of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), i.e. \\(\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{\\sigma_Y^2}\\) under \\(H_0\\) alternative: the type of alternative hypothesis, where two.sided corresponds to \\(\\sigma_X^2 \\neq \\sigma_Y^2\\), greater corresponds to \\(\\sigma_X^2 &gt; \\sigma_Y^2\\), and less corresponds to \\(\\sigma_X^2 &lt; \\sigma_Y^2\\). conf.level: confidence level, which equals to \\(1-\\alpha\\) (significance level). Test for population proportions The exact Binomial test can be implemented in R by using binom.test: binom.test(x, n, p = 0.5, alternative = c(&quot;two.sided&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;), conf.level = 0.95) x: number of successes n: number of trials p: hypothesized probability of success, i.e. \\(\\pi\\) under \\(H_0\\) alternative and conf.level: same as explained in the var.test function. Testing the proportion of successes in a Binomial experiment with normal approximation can be performed by using prop.test: prop.test(x, n, p = NULL, alternative = c(&quot;two.sided&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;), conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE) All arguments are the same as in the binom.test() function. Goodness-of-fit test The test criterion for testing \\(H_0: F_X(x) = F_0(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) against the alternative \\(H_1: F_X(x) \\neq F_0(x)\\) for some \\(x\\) when the null hypothesis is completely specified is \\[\\chi^2_\\text{obs} = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\frac{(O_k-E_k)^2}{E_k},\\] where \\(K\\) is the total number of categories. For large \\(n\\), provided all expected categories are at least 5, \\(\\chi^2_\\text{obs}\\) is distributed approximately \\(\\chi^2_{K-1}\\). The test can be performed by using chisq.test: chisq.test(x, p) x: a vector of observed counts in each category p: a vector of probabilities for the observations falling into each category "],["example-1-diode-diameter-hypothesis-test.html", "2 Example 1: Diode Diameter Hypothesis Test 2.1 Verifying normality 2.2 Step 1 - Hypotheses 2.3 Step 2 - Test Statistic 2.4 Step 3 - Hypothesis Test Calculations 2.5 Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion 2.6 Step 5 - English Conclusion", " 2 Example 1: Diode Diameter Hypothesis Test In the construction of a safety strobe, a particular manufacturer can purchase LED diodes from one of two suppliers. It is critical that the purchased diodes conform to their stated specifications with respect to diameter since they must be mated with a fixed width cable. The diameter in millimeters for a random sample of 15 diodes from each of the two suppliers was taken. The diameters can be found in the LEDDIODE data frame in the PASWR2 package. Question of interest: Does this data provide evidence to suggest a difference in variabilities between the two suppliers? Use a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) for any tests. Reminder of how to access data Install or load the package and then save the data to your environment. E.g: library(PASWR2) LEDDIODE &lt;- LEDDIODE 2.1 Verifying normality Before we start, let's note that this test is to compare variances of two unpaired samples. This means the type of test we will use is an \\(F\\)-test. As always, we should start by verifying the normality assumption required for this test. We should do this with ggplot: ggplot(data = LEDDIODE, aes(diameter, fill = supplier)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + xlim(min(density.default(x = LEDDIODE$diameter)$x), max(density.default(x = LEDDIODE$diameter)$x)) + theme_bw() ggplot(data = LEDDIODE, aes(sample = diameter, color = supplier)) + stat_qq() + theme_bw() Based on the density plots and quantile-quantile normal plots, it seems reasonable to assume the LED diode widths from both suppliers follow normal distributions. Therefore, proceed with the five-step procedure. 2.2 Step 1 - Hypotheses Hypotheses — The null and alternative hypotheses to test whether the variability in LED diode widths using supplier A’s (X) diodes is not equal to the variability in LED diode widths using supplier B’s (Y) diodes are: \\[H_0 : \\sigma^2_X = \\sigma_Y^2 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_1 : \\sigma^2_X \\neq \\sigma_Y^2\\] 2.3 Step 2 - Test Statistic The test statistics chosen are \\(S^2_X\\) and \\(S^2_Y\\) since \\(E[S^2_X] = \\sigma^2_X\\) and \\(E[S^2_Y] = \\sigma^2_Y\\). VAR &lt;- tapply(LEDDIODE$diameter, LEDDIODE$supplier, var) VAR ## supplierA supplierB ## 0.06495524 0.01506381 The value of the test statistics are \\(s^2_X = 0.0650\\) and \\(s^2_Y = 0.0151\\). We will determine the probability of obtaining this test statistic when the null hypothesis is true. We do this with standardisation and the probability is called the \\(p\\)-value. The standardised test statistic is calculated under the assumption that \\(H_0\\) is true and its distribution for this test are \\[\\frac{S^2_X}{S^2_Y} \\sim F_{15−1, 15-1}\\] This is what will be used to complete the test. 2.4 Step 3 - Hypothesis Test Calculations 2.4.1 Finding the rejection region Before we continue to analyse our data we must find the rejection region: Because the standardised test statistic is distributed \\(F_{14,14}\\), and \\(H_1\\) is a two-sided hypothesis, the rejection region is \\(f_{obs} &lt; F_{0.005;14,14}\\) or \\(f_{obs} &gt; F_{0.995;14,14}\\) From the statistical tables or from R, the \\(F\\)-values that correspond to the significance level (critical values) are \\(F_{0.005;14,14} = 0.2326\\) and \\(F_{0.995;14,14} = 4.2993\\). RRupper &lt;- qf(0.995, 14, 14) RRlower &lt;- qf(0.005, 14, 14) c(RRlower, RRupper) ## [1] 0.2325967 4.2992869 This gives us the critical values which make up the limits of the rejection region (what we will compare our result to). Remember you can sketch these if it helps to see the rejection region graphically. 2.4.2 Finding the standardised test statistic and \\(p\\)-value The test we are running here is an \\(F\\) test on variances. We can calculate the standardised test statistics by hand or with R. In R: f_obs &lt;- VAR[1]/VAR[2] f_obs ## supplierA ## 4.312006 This gives our standardised test statistic as \\(f_{obs} = \\frac{s^2_X}{s^2_Y}= \\frac{0.065}{0.0151} = 4.312\\) and the corresponding \\(p\\)-value \\(2*\\mathrm{P}(F_{14,14} \\geq 4.312) = 0.0099\\). 2*pf(f_obs, 14, 14, lower=FALSE) ## supplierA ## 0.009861004 R also has a built-in function, var.test to perform the \\(F\\)-test of equality of variances, which automatically return the value of standardised test statistic and \\(p\\)-value.

Remember this is both ends of the F-distribution for this two-sided test. QUESTION: Do we reject our null hypothesis? Solution I. From the rejection region, we reject \\(H_0\\) because \\(f_{obs} = 4.312\\) is greater than 4.2993 and is inside the rejection region (in its upper tail). OR From the \\(p\\)-value, we reject \\(H_0\\) because the \\(p\\)-value \\(0.0099 &lt; 0.01\\). Whichever method we use, we reject \\(H_0\\). 2.6 Step 5 - English Conclusion What does the previous statistical conclusion mean for the data and the purpose of the test? QUESTION: Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test? There is evidence to suggest the variability of the width of LED diodes from supplier A is not equal to the variance for the width of LED diodes from supplier B. There is evidence to suggest the variability of the width of LED diodes from supplier A is equal to the variance for the width of LED diodes from supplier B. There is insufficient evidence to suggest the variability of the width of LED diodes from supplier A is equal to the variance for the width of LED diodes from supplier B. We cannot conclude if there is sufficient evidence to suggest the variability of the width of LED diodes from supplier A is not equal to the variance for the width of LED diodes from supplier B.

The critical value is the \\(t\\) value that corresponds to the significance level of 0.05, and hence is the bottom limit of our rejection region.

Remember this is at the upper end of the \\(\\chi^2\\)-distribution for this one-sided test. QUESTION: Do we reject the null hypothesis? Solution I.

Using the variable elevator from the dataframe VIT2005 in the package PASWR2, answer the questions below: 1. Can the director’s claim about elevators be substantiated using an exact method to reach a conclusion? 2. Can the director’s claim about elevators be substantiated using an approximate method to reach a conclusion? Is this test in agreement with the exact method test above? Use a 10% significance level for all tests. 4.1 Question 1 4.1.1 Step 1 - Hypotheses For this question, we will complete an exact test for testing the proportion of successes in a Binomial distribution. Let \\(\\pi\\) denote the probability that an apartment has an elevator.

(Typically we will not find the rejection region nor standardise the test statistic.) What is the \\(p\\)-value in this case? \\(p\\)-value\\(=\\) Hint For an upper-tail one-sided test, \\(p\\)-value is the probability of seeing the value of test statistic or even more extreme values under the assumption that \\(H_0\\) is true, i.e. \\(p\\text{-value} = P(Y\\geq y_{obs}|H_0) = P(Y \\geq 174|Y \\sim Bin(218,0.75)\\).

What is the \\(p\\)-value in this case? \\(p\\)-value\\(=\\) Solution The \\(p\\)-value is the area under the normal distribution curve that corresponds to the standardised test statistics (with continuity correction) we just calculated, i.e. \\(P(Z \\geq z_\\text{obs})\\). This can be found in the statistical tables or in R: pnorm(zobs, lower=FALSE) ## [1] 0.05889425 We can also find the value of standardised test statistic and \\(p\\)-value using the R function prop.test.

Yes, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that over 75% of all apartments have an elevator. No, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that over 75% of all apartments have an elevator. Solution I. From the rejection region, we reject \\(H_0\\) because \\(z_{obs} = 1.5641\\) is greater than 1.2816 and is therefore inside the rejection region when using continuity correction. OR From the p-value, we reject \\(H_0\\) because the \\(p\\)-value (with continuity correction) \\(0.0589\\) is less than 0.1. Whichever method we use, we reject \\(H_0\\).

The significance level is 5%. 5.1 Step 1: construct the observed and expected values for different categories To start with, we look at the data to determine how many categories should be created. FT &lt;- xtabs(~number, data = DEPEND) FT ## number ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 9 13 13 7 4 3 1 Based on the frequency table for the number of dependent children, the cells with four, five, and six children are combined into a single cell for four or more children. After the merge, we get the observed number of children for five categories as follows: obs &lt;- c(9, 13, 13, 7, 8) Under the null hypothesis that \\(F_0(x)\\) is a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda=2\\), the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more dependent children are computed with R as follows: null.p &lt;- c(dpois(0, 2), dpois(1, 2), dpois(2, 2), dpois(3, 2), ppois(3, 2, lower = FALSE)) null.p ## [1] 0.1353353 0.2706706 0.2706706 0.1804470 0.1428765 Since there were a total of \\(n = 50\\) families, the expected number of dependent children for the five categories is simply \\(50 \\times\\)null.p. EX &lt;- 50*null.p EX ## [1] 6.766764 13.533528 13.533528 9.022352 7.143827 We are now ready to conduct the hypothesis test. 5.2 Step 1 - Hypotheses The null and alternative hypotheses for using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test to test the hypothesis that the number of dependent children follows a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2\\) are: \\[ \\begin{split} &amp;H_0: F_X(x) = F_0(x) \\sim Pois(\\lambda = 2.5) \\text{ for all } x \\textit{ versus}\\\\ &amp;H_1: F_X(x) \\neq F_0(x) \\text{ for some }x. \\end{split}\\] 5.3 Step 2 - Choosing a Test Statistic The test statistic chosen is \\(\\chi^2_\\text{obs} = \\sum_{k=1}^5 \\frac{(O_k-E_k)^2}{E_k}\\). 5.4 Step 3 - Rejection Region Calculations Reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\chi^2_\\text{obs} &gt; \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha;K-1}\\), where \\(K\\) denotes the number of categories. QUESTION: Find the value of the test statistic. \\(\\chi^2_\\text{obs}\\)= Find the critical value. \\(\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha;k-1}\\)= Find the \\(p\\)-value. \\(p\\)-value= Solution Using R, we can find the value of test statistic, the critical value, and \\(p\\)-value (\\(P(\\chi^2_4 \\geq \\chi^2_\\text{obs})\\)) as follows. chi.obs &lt;- sum((obs - EX)^2/EX) #value of the test statistic chi.obs ## [1] 1.33502 qchisq(0.95, 4) #critical value ## [1] 9.487729 pchisq(chi.obs, 4, lower=FALSE) #p-value ## [1] 0.8554064 chisq.test(x=obs, p=null.p) ## ## Chi-squared test for given probabilities ## ## data: obs ## X-squared = 1.335, df = 4, p-value = 0.8554 We can find the value of test statistic and \\(p\\)-value by using the R function chisq.test. chisq.test(x=obs, p=null.p) ## ## Chi-squared test for given probabilities ## ## data: obs ## X-squared = 1.335, df = 4, p-value = 0.8554 In the output, X-squared gives the value of test statistic, df is the degrees of freedom for this \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution, and p-value gives the \\(p\\)-value. 5.5 Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion Do we reject the null hypothesis? Yes No Solution I. Since \\(\\chi^2_\\text{obs}=1.335\\) is not greater than \\(\\chi^2_{0.95;4}= 9.4877\\), fail to reject \\(H_0\\). OR Since \\(p\\)-value\\(=0.8554 &gt; 0.05\\), fail to reject \\(H_0\\). 5.6 Step 5 - English Conclusion Which of the following is the correct conclusion of our test? There is evidence to suggest that the true cdf equals the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2\\) for all \\(x\\). There is evidence to suggest that the true cdf equals the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2\\) for at least one \\(x\\). There is no evidence to suggest that the true cdf does not equal the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2\\) for at least one \\(x\\). There is no evidence to suggest that the true cdf does not equal the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2\\) for all \\(x\\). 1234 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
