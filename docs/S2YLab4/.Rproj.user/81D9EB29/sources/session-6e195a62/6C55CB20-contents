# Exercise 5: Identifying relationships


If we had data for the following studies, determine whether fitting a regression model would be appropriate or produce meaningful results. If a regression model is appropriate, identify which variable is the **response variable** and which is the **explanatory variable**.



(a) A study investigated whether federal spending, on average, is higher or lower in countries with higher rates of poverty.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c(answer="Yes", "No"))`

|        Federal spending: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", answer="Response", "N/A"))`

|        Poverty rates: `r mcq(c(answer="Explanatory", "Response", "N/A"))`

<br>

(b) A study was conducted to determine whether surgery or chemotherapy results in higher survival rates for a certain type of cancer.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c(answer="Yes", "No"))` 

|        Type of treatment: `r mcq(c(answer="Explanatory", "Response", "N/A"))`

|        Survival rates: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", answer="Response", "N/A"))`

<br>

(c) A study found that, overall, left-handed people die at a younger age than right-handed people.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c("Yes", answer="No"))` 

|        Age of death: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", "Response", answer="N/A"))`

|        Left- or right-handed: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", "Response", answer="N/A"))`

<br>

(d) A study to determine if per capita cheese consumption is correlated with the number of people who died getting tangled in bed sheets.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c("Yes", answer="No"))`

|        Number of people who died getting tangled in bed sheets: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", "Response", answer="N/A"))`

|        Per capita cheese consumption: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", "Response", answer="N/A"))`

<br>

(e) An experiment was conducted to test the effects of sleep deprivation on human reaction times.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c(answer="Yes", "No"))` 

|        Hours of sleep: `r mcq(c(answer="Explanatory", "Response", "N/A"))` 

|        Reaction times: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", answer="Response", "N/A"))`

<br>

(f) A study was conducted in order to predict the GPA of university students given their high school GPA.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c(answer="Yes", "No"))`

|        GPA of university students: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", answer="Response", "N/A"))` 

|        High school GPA: `r mcq(c(answer="Explanatory", "Response", "N/A"))`

<br>

(g) A company ran a study to find out if there is a significant relationship between its advertising expenditures and its sales volume.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c(answer="Yes", "No"))` 

|        Advertising expenditures: `r mcq(c(answer="Explanatory", "Response", "N/A"))` 

|        Sales volume: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", answer="Response", "N/A"))`

<br>

(h) A sample of insured drivers with similar insurance policies were randomly selected. Interest is in determining whether there is a significant relationship between driving experience and insurance premium.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c(answer="Yes", "No"))` 

|        Driving experience: `r mcq(c(answer="Explanatory", "Response", "N/A"))`

|        Insurance premium: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", answer="Response", "N/A"))` 

<br>

(i) A study was run to investigate if ice cream sales are correlated with murder rates in the US.

|        Regression model appropriate? `r mcq(c("Yes", answer="No"))`

|        Murder rates: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", "Response", answer="N/A"))`

|        Ice cream sales: `r mcq(c("Explanatory", "Response", answer="N/A"))`
