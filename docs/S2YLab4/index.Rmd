# Welcome to Lab 3

Intended Learning Outcomes:

- Produce scatterplots of report quality;

- Calculate and interpret the sample correlation coefficient;

- Fit linear regression models by using `lm`;

- Interpret least squares estimates of model parameters.



## Credit where credit is due

The labs in S2 incorporate and adapt materials from:

Ugarte, M. D., Militino, A. F., & Arnholt, A. T. (2008). [Probability and Statistics with R](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/gla/detail.action?docID=5338596). CRC press.

The materials were converted into interactive labs on Hypothesis Testing using `Bookdown` and `webexercises` in Summer 2023 by summer project student, Megan Ruffle.
