# Welcome to Lab 9!

Intended Learning Outcomes:

1. Produce residual plots and assess the assumptions of a linear model. 
2. Fit linear models with transformed variable. 

## Introduction variable transformations
The need to transform variables may arise during the exploratory analysis when you realize that your predictor(s) do not have a linear relationship with the response, or during assumption checking when the residuals do not meet assumptions. Either way, a transformation of the response variable, the predictors, or both response and predictors may be necessary.

Once the model has been fitted using a transformation, it possible to report the findings in the original scale, using back-transformation. This means, we apply the inverse of our transformation to our predictions. 

In this section, we will explore what transformations may be necessary in your model. 

## Root 
A root transformation is one where you take a root of the variable. For example, you may take the square or cubic root. In the case that a square root transformation may be needed, you can fit it in a model using:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Model without transformation
model <- lm(y ~ x)
# Model with transformation
model.root <- lm(y ~ I(x^0.5))
```

Recognizing the need for the transformation is important. We can perform a small simulation to give you a taste for a predictor in need of a square root transformation looks like. 
```{r, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warnings= FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123) # Ignore this line

# Simulate data from a simple linear model
n <- 100
beta_0 <- 1
beta_1 <- 1.5
x.trans <- runif(n, min = 0, max =2)
Y <- beta_0 + beta_1*x.trans + rnorm(n, 0, sd = 0.2)
x <- x.trans^2
```

```{r root, fig.cap="Left: Scatterplot of Y vs x in the original scale. Right: Scatterplot after the square-root transformation of $x$", fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(Y~x, pch = 16, 
     main = "Original Scale")
plot(Y~I(x^0.5), pch = 16, 
    main = "After Square-root Transformation")

```
## Reciprocal
The reciprocal transformation of $x$ is the same as saying $\frac{1}{x}$. You can fit it in a model using:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Model without transformation
model <- lm(y ~ x)
# Model with transformation
model.root <- lm(y ~ I(x^-1))
```

But, what does the data needing a reciprocal transformation look like? 
```{r, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warnings= FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123) # Ignore this line

# Simulate data from a simple linear model
beta_0 <- 1
beta_1 <- 1.5
x.trans <- runif(n, min = 0, max =2)
Y <- beta_0 + beta_1*x.trans + rnorm(n, 0, sd = 0.2)
x <- 1/x.trans
```

```{r reciprocal, fig.cap="Left: Scatterplot of Y vs x in the original scale. Right: Scatterplot after the reciprocal transformation of $x$", fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(Y~x, pch = 16, 
     main = "Original Scale")
plot(Y~I(x^-1), pch = 16, 
    main = "After Reciprocal Transformation")

```
## Quadratic
The quadratic transformation of $x$ is the same as saying $x^2$. It is the inverse of the square-root transformation. It it a subset of the power transformation. More generalised, it is $x^a$, where $a$ is anything. The reciprocal can also be thought of in this same category. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Model without transformation
model <- lm(y ~ x)
# Model with transformation
model.root <- lm(y ~ I(x^2))
```

But, what does the data needing a reciprocal transformation look like? 
```{r, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warnings= FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123) # Ignore this line

# Simulate data from a simple linear model
n <- 100
beta_0 <- 1
beta_1 <- 1.5
x.trans <- runif(n, min = 0, max =2)
Y <- beta_0 + beta_1*x.trans + rnorm(n, 0, sd = 0.2)
x <- sqrt(x.trans)
```

```{r quadratic, fig.cap="Left: Scatterplot of Y vs x in the original scale. Right: Scatterplot after the quadratic transformation of $x$", fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(Y~x, pch = 16, 
     main = "Original Scale")
plot(Y~I(x^2), pch = 16, 
    main = "After Reciprocal Transformation")

```

## Logarithmic
Last but not least, the logarithmic transformation. It is equivalent to saying $ln(x)$, which in `R` is the same as `log(x)`. Unlike many other transformations, models that use logarithmic transformations have approximate explanations without back-transforming the variables.

When $x$ has been transformed with a natural log transformation, the change in the
$ln(x)$ is roughly equal to the change in $x$ provided the changes in $x$ are small. Consider
the figure below, which graphically illustrates how changing the x values 3 and 6 by 10%
corresponds to an approximate increase in $ln(x)$ of about $10\%$.
