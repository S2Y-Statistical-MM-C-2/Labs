# Exercise 1: Identify the appropriate transformation

The following simulated data contain different non-linear relationships between response and predictor
variables. Encourage students to create scatterplots, build models and examine residual plots to determine
what would be the most appropriate transformation to linearise the relationship.

**Data:** `SIMDATAXT` and `SIMDATAST`

**Columns:** 

|                       **C1:** `x1` - predictor 1

|                       **C2:** `x2` - predictor 2

|                       **C3:** `x3` - predictor 3

Read in the data using:
```{r, include = T, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(PASWR2)
data("SIMDATAXT")
data("SIMDATAST")
```
**QUESTIONS**: 

(a) Using the data `SIMDATAXT`, apply appropriate transformations to $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ to linearize the relationships between the response and predictors one at a time. 

It might be best if you break it down and address one predictor at the time. 

**Transform $x_1$**

The plots `r mcq(c(answer="SUGGEST", "DO NOT SUGGEST"))` using a `r mcq(c(answer="square root", "quadratic", "logarithmic", "reciprocal"))` transformation for $x_1$. 

`r hide ("Hint")`
You can begin by examining the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ and the relationship between the two in a simple linear model. 
```{r}
# Plot relationship
plot(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
# Fit and plot model
model1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model1)
```
Is the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ linear?
`r unhide ()`

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
model1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model1)
# Figures suggest a square root transformation
plot(y ~ sqrt(x1), data = SIMDATAXT)
model2 <- lm(y ~ sqrt(x1), data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model2) # Much better!
```
`r unhide()`

**Transform $x_2$**
The second predictor can be evaluated in the same way as the first. 

The plots `r mcq(c(answer="SUGGEST", "DO NOT SUGGEST"))` using a `r mcq(c(answer="quadratic", "square root", "logarithmic","reciprocal"))` transformation for $x_2$. 

`r hide ("Hint")`
You can begin by examining the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ and the relationship between the two in a simple linear model. 
```{r}
# Plot relationship
plot(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
# Fit and plot model
model3 <- lm(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model3)
```
Is the relationship between $y$ and $x_2$ linear?
Play around with transformations to see which is best. 
`r unhide ()`

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
model3 <- lm(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model3)
# Figures suggest a square root transformation
plot(y ~ I(x2^2), data = SIMDATAXT)
model4 <- lm(y ~ I(x2^2), data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model4) 
```
`r unhide()`

**Transform $x_3$**
 
The plots `r mcq(c(answer="SUGGEST", "DO NOT SUGGEST"))` using a `r mcq(c(answer="reciprocal", "square root", "logarithmic","quadratic"))` transformation for $x_3$. 

`r hide ("Hint")`
You can begin by examining the relationship between $y$ and $x_3$ and the relationship between the two in a simple linear model. 
```{r}
# Plot relationship
plot(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
# Fit and plot model
model5 <- lm(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model5)
```
Is the relationship between $y$ and $x_3$ linear?
Play around with transformations to see which is best. 
`r unhide ()`

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
model5 <- lm(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model5)
# Figures suggest a square root transformation
plot(y ~ I(x3^(-1)), data = SIMDATAXT)
model6 <- lm(y ~ I(x2^(-1)), data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model6) 
```
`r unhide()`

(b) Using the data `SIMDATAST`, figure out the appropriate transformation for $x_1$ and/or $y$. 

The plots `r mcq(c(answer="SUGGEST", "DO NOT SUGGEST"))` using a `r mcq(c(answer="logarithmic", "square root", "reciprocal","quadratic"))` transformation for `r mcq(c(answer="Y","x1","both","none"))`. 

`r hide ("Hint")`
**1.** Plot the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$.
Is the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ linear? Play around to see what transformation could be better. 
**2.** Fit a model between $y$ and $x_1$.
What are the residuals telling you?
`r unhide ()`

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
model1b <- lm(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model1b)
# Figures suggest transforming the response
plot(log(y) ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
model2b <- lm(log(y) ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model2b) 
```
`r unhide()`

(c) Using the data `SIMDATAST`, figure out the appropriate transformation for $x_2$ and/or $y$.

The plots `r mcq(c(answer="SUGGEST", "DO NOT SUGGEST"))` using a `r mcq(c(answer="reciprocal", "square root", "logarithmic","quadratic"))` transformation for `r mcq(c(answer="Y","x2","both","none"))`. 

`r hide ("Hint")`
**1.** Plot the relationship between $y$ and $x_2$.
Is the relationship between $y$ and $x_2$ linear? Play around to see what transformation could be better. 
**2.** Fit a model between $y$ and $x_2$.
What are the residuals telling you?
`r unhide ()`

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
model1c <- lm(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model1c)
# Figures suggest transforming the response
plot(log(y) ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
model2c <- lm(log(y) ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model2c) 
```
`r unhide()`
