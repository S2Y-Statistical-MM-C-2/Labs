# Exercise 1: Identify the appropriate transformation

The following simulated data contain different non-linear relationships between response and predictor
variables. 

**Data:** `SIMDATAXT` and `SIMDATAST`

**Columns:** 

|                       **C1:** `x1` - predictor 1

|                       **C2:** `x2` - predictor 2

|                       **C3:** `x3` - predictor 3

Read in the data using:
```{r, include = T, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(PASWR2)
data("SIMDATAXT")
data("SIMDATAST")
```

**QUESTIONS**: 

(a) Using the data `SIMDATAXT`, apply appropriate transformations to $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ to linearise the relationships between the response and predictors one at a time. 

It might be best if you break it down and address one predictor at the time. 

**Transform $x_1$**
You can begin by examining the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ at the original scale and in a simple linear model. 
`r hide ("Hint")`
```{r}
# Plot relationship
plot(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
# Fit and plot model
model1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model1,which=c(1))
```
The relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ is curved and convex. 
`r unhide ()`

Apply the transformation you think is necessary and fit a model.\ 
From the figures, the appropriate transformation of $x_1$ is the `r mcq(c(answer="square root", "quadratic", "logarithmic", "reciprocal", "none"))` . 

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
model1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model1,which=c(1)
# Figures suggest a square root transformation
plot(y ~ sqrt(x1), data = SIMDATAXT)
model2 <- lm(y ~ sqrt(x1), data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model2,which=c(1)) # Much better!
```
`r unhide()`

<!-- From all the figuresof $x_1$ against $Y$ to analize the relationship between predictor and response. Are transformations necessary? -->


**Transform $x_2$**
The second predictor can be evaluated in the same way as the first. You can begin by examining the relationship between $y$ and $x_2$ and the relationship between the two in a simple linear model using scatterplots. 

`r hide ("Hint")`

```{r}
# Plot relationship
plot(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
# Fit and plot model
model3 <- lm(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model3,which=c(1))
```
The relationship seems both curved and concave. 
`r unhide ()`

Apply the transformation you think is necessary and fit a model. \
From the figures, the appropriate transformation of $x_2$ is  `r mcq(c(answer="quadratic", "square root", "logarithmic","reciprocal", "none"))`. 

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
model3 <- lm(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model3,which=c(1))
# Figures suggest a square root transformation
plot(y ~ I(x2^2), data = SIMDATAXT)
model4 <- lm(y ~ I(x2^2), data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model4,which=c(1)) 
```
`r unhide()`



**Transform $x_3$**
Plot $y$ and $x_3$ and the residuals of a simple linear model to assess the relationship between the two. 

`r hide ("Hint")`

```{r}
# Plot relationship
plot(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
# Fit and plot model
model5 <- lm(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model5,which=c(1))
```
The relationship seems curved and concave. 
`r unhide ()`

Apply the transformation you think is necessary and fit a model. \
The figures suggest a `r mcq(c(answer="reciprocal", "square root", "logarithmic","quadratic", "none"))` transformation for $x_3$. 


`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
model5 <- lm(y ~ x3, data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model5)
# Figures suggest a square root transformation
plot(y ~ I(x3^(-1)), data = SIMDATAXT)
model6 <- lm(y ~ I(x2^(-1)), data = SIMDATAXT)
plot(model6) 
```
`r unhide()`



(b) Using the data `SIMDATAST`, figure out the appropriate transformation for $x_1$ and/or $y$. 
Follow the usual steps by producing a scatterplot of $y$ and $x_1$ and the residuals of the simple linear model at original scale. Consider the possible transformations. 

The figures suggest using a `r mcq(c(answer="logarithmic", "square root", "reciprocal","quadratic", "none"))` transformation for `r mcq(c(answer="Y","x1","both","none"))`. 

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
model1b <- lm(y ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model1b)
# Figures suggest transforming the response
plot(log(y) ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
model2b <- lm(log(y) ~ x1, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model2b) 
```
`r unhide()`

(c) Using the data `SIMDATAST`, figure out the appropriate transformation for $x_2$ and/or $y$.
Follow the steps outlined in (b). 

The figures suggest using a `r mcq(c(answer="reciprocal", "square root", "logarithmic","quadratic","none"))` transformation for `r mcq(c(answer="Y","x2","both","none"))`. 

`r hide ("Solution")`
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Before transformation
plot(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
model1c <- lm(y ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model1c)
# Figures suggest transforming the response
plot(log(y) ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
model2c <- lm(log(y) ~ x2, data = SIMDATAST)
plot(model2c) 
```
`r unhide()`
