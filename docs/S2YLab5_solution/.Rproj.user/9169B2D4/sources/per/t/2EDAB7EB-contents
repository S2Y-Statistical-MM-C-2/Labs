# Exercise 1: Plant Height Hypothesis Test

Using the data frame `Fertilize` in the package `PASWR`, which contains the height in inches for plants for cross fertilization and self-fertilization, test if the data suggest that the average height of self-fertilized plants is more than 17 inches. (Use \(\alpha = 0.05\)).

**1) a) Does this data fit the required assumption of normality to perform a hypothesis test?**

`r hide()`

1 a) We can verify the normality assumption of the data using exploratory data analysis (`EDA()`).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(PASWR)
FERTILIZE <- Fertilize
EDA(FERTILIZE$self)

```

The results from applying the function `EDA()` to self fertilized plants suggest it is not unreasonable to assume that plant height for self fertilized plants follows a normal distribution. Now, proceed with the five-step procedure.
`r unhide()`



**1) b) Step 1 - select the correct hypothesis:**


To test whether the height of self fertilized plants is greater than \(17\) inches, the correct null and alternative hypotheses are:

\begin{align} 
1&. \quad H_0 : \mu = 17 \quad \text{verses} \quad H_1 : \mu < 17\\
O&R\\
2&. \quad H_0 : \mu = 17 \quad \text{verses} \quad H_1 : \mu > 17 \\
O&R\\
3&. \quad H_0 : \mu = 17 \quad \text{verses} \quad H_1 : \mu \neq 17
\end{align}
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcqhyp <- c("1",answer="2","3")
```
`r mcq(mcqhyp)`

**1) c) Step 2 - Choose and calculate the test statistic (before standardisation).**

The test statistic \(\bar{X}=\)


`r hide()`

1) c) The test statistic chosen is \(\bar{X}\) because \(E[\bar{X}] = \mu\).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
xbar <- mean(FERTILIZE$self)
xbar
```
The value of this test statistic is \(\bar{x} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}x_i}{n} = 17.575\)

`r unhide()`


**1) d) Step 3a - Finding rejection region \(t_{obs} > t_{1-0.05; df}\).**

i) Find the degrees of freedom.

ii) Find the critical value \(t_{1-0.05; df} =\)

`r hide()`
1) d) i) Because the standardized test statistic is distributed \(t_{14}\) and \(H_1\) is a upper one-sided hypothesis, the rejection region is the \(t_{obs} > t_{1-0.05; 14} = t_{0.95; 14}\)

1) d) ii) From the statistical tables, the t-value that corresponds to our significance level (critical value), \( t_{0.95; 14} = 1.7613\). Remember this is positive because we are discussing the upper tail of the t-distribution.

This same t-value can be found using R:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
RR <- qt(0.95, df = 14)
RR
```
`r unhide()`



**1) e) Step 3b - Finding the standardisied test statistic and p-value for our data.**

The standardized test statistic under the assumption that \(H_0\) is true and its distribution are \(\frac{\bar{X}−\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{df}\).

i) Calculate the standardisied test statistic.

`r hide()`
1) e) i) Our standardised test statistic =  \(\frac{\bar{X}−\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{17.575−17}{S/\sqrt{n}}\).
From our data set in R we can obtain \(S\) and \(n\):

```{r, eval=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
S <- sd(FERTILIZE$self)
S

n <- length(FERTILIZE$self)
n
```

This gives our standardised test statistic \(t_{obs}=\frac{\bar{X}−\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} = 1.0854\):

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sta.test.stat <- (17.575-17)/(S/sqrt(n))
sta.test.stat
```
**OR**

The standardised test statistic can be found using:
```{r}
Test <- t.test(FERTILIZE$self, mu = 17, alternative = "greater")
Test
```


`r unhide()`


ii) Calculate the p-value that corresponds to our standardised test statistic.

`r hide()`

1) e) ii)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
pvalue <- 1-pt(1.085437, df=14)
pvalue
```

Graphically this could be shown:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(latex2exp)

alpha <- 0.05
critical_value <- -1*qt(alpha, df = Inf)
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 1000)
t_dist <- data.frame(x = x, y = dt(x, df = Inf))

# Create t distribution plot and alpha below in the funtion is transparency of the region
t_plot <- ggplot(t_dist, aes(x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = y), size = 1) +
  geom_area(data = subset(t_dist, x > critical_value), aes(y = y), fill = "red", alpha=0.2) +
  geom_area(data = subset(t_dist, x > sta.test.stat), aes(y = y), fill = "blue", alpha=0.1) +
  labs(title = TeX("T Distribution with Rejection Region for One-tail test with $\\alpha = 0.05$"),
       x = "T-Score",
       y = "Probability Density") +
annotate("text", x = critical_value + 0.2, y = 0.02, label = TeX("$\\alpha = 0.05$"), size = 2.5, colour="red") +
annotate("text", x = 1.9, y = -0.02, label = TeX("1.7613"), vjust = 0.4, size=3) +
annotate("text", x = sta.test.stat-0.5, y = 0.1, label = TeX("$\\p = 0.1480328$"), size = 2.5, colour="blue") +
annotate("text", x = 0.8, y = -0.02, label = "1.0854", vjust = 0.4, size=3) +
theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
print(t_plot)

```
Our standardised test statistic is greater than  the critical value and outside our rejection region. Hence our p-value is greater than \(\alpha\)


**OR**

The p-value can be found using:
```{r}
Test <- t.test(FERTILIZE$self, mu = 17, alternative = "greater")
Test
```
`r unhide()`


**1) f) Step 4 - Statistical Conclusion**

Do we reject our null hypothesis?

`r hide()`

1) f) 
I. From the rejection region, we fail to reject \(H_0\) because the standardised test statistic is less than the critical value and hence outside the rejection region i.e \(t_{obs} = 1.0854 < 1.7613\).

OR

II. From the p-value, we fail to reject \(H_0\) because the p-value\( 0.1480 > 0.05\).


Whichever method we use, we fail to reject \(H_0\).

`r unhide()`

**1) g) Step 5 - English Conclusion**

Is there statistical evidence to suggest a mean greater than 17?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcqconc <- c("There is sufficient evidence to suggest the average height of self-fertilized plants is more than 17 inches", "We cannot conclude if there is sufficient evidence to suggest the average height of self-fertilized plants is more than 17 inches.",
answer = "There is not sufficient evidence to suggest the the average height of self-fertilized plants is more than 17 inches.",
"There is sufficient evidence to suggest the average height of self-fertilized plants is less than 17 inches.")
```
`r longmcq(mcqconc)`
