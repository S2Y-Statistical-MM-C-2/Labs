# Example 2: Power of a test

A cell phone provider has estimated that it needs revenues of €2 million per day in order to make a profit and remain in the market. If revenues are less than €2 million per day, the company will go bankrupt. Likewise, revenues greater than €2 million per day cannot be handled without increasing staff. Assume that revenues follow a normal distribution with \(\sigma =\) €0.5 million and a mean of \(\mu\).

To find out more about their revenue they want to perform a hypothesis test \(H_0 : \mu = 2\) versus \(H_1 : \mu \neq 2\). To understand more about how hypothesis tests work, three scenarios will be presented to show how the power of a test can change: varying mu, varying significance level and varying sample size. 


The power function is:

\[Power(\theta) = P(\text{reject }H_0|H_0 \text{ is false}) = P(\text{accept }H_1|H1) = 1-\beta(\theta)\]

where \(\beta(\theta)\) is the probability of a type II error at a given \(\theta\)




## **Question 1**

**Aim:**

**Graphically depict the power function for testing \(H_0 : \mu = 2\) versus \(H_1 : \mu \neq 2\) if \(n = 150\) and \(\alpha = 0.05\) for values of \(\mu\) ranging from 1.8 to 2.2.**

- First we think about whether we are doing a one or two-tailed test and what values represent rejecting or no-rejecting them.

- Than we should start by making a vector of the values of \(\mu\).

- Then you will need to find the critical values for our significance level \(\alpha\) which are used to calculate the power can be found for each \(\mu\).

The power values could be to be written as a data frame to make the plotting easier. 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
mu <- seq(from = 1.8, to = 2.2, length = 500)
n <- 150
alpha <- 0.05
sigma <- 0.5

lcv <- qnorm(alpha/2, 2, sigma/sqrt(n))
ucv <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2, 2, sigma/sqrt(n))

Power <- pnorm(lcv, mu, sigma/sqrt(n)) + pnorm(ucv, mu, sigma/sqrt(n), lower = FALSE)

DF <- data.frame(mu, Power)
```

Once we have vales for how the power function changes with \(\mu\), we should use ggplot to graph it:
```{r eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = mu, y = Power)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = expression(mu), y = expression(Power~(mu))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, color = "blue", lty = "dashed")
```

## **Question 2**

Graphically depict the power function for testing \(H_0 : \mu = 2\) versus \(H_1 : \mu \neq 2\) when \(\mu_1 = 2.1\) and \(n = 150\) for values of \(\alpha\) ranging from 0.001 to 0.999.

`r hide("Hint 1")`
Think about whether you are doing a one or two-tailed test and what values represent rejecting or no-rejecting them.
`r unhide()`

`r hide("Hint 2")`
First make a vector of values of \(\alpha\).

Then you will need to find the confidence values for each \(\alpha\) which are used to calculate the corresponding test powers.

The power values could be to be written as a data frame to make the plotting easier. 
`r unhide()`

```{r eval = TRUE, webex.hide="Calculations Solution"}
alpha <- seq(from = 0.001, to = 0.999, length = 500)
mu <- 2.1
sigma <- 0.5
n <- 150

lcv <- qnorm(alpha/2, 2, sigma/sqrt(n))
ucv <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2, 2, sigma/sqrt(n))

Power <- pnorm(lcv, mu, sigma/sqrt(n)) + pnorm(ucv, mu, sigma/sqrt(n), lower = FALSE)

DF <- data.frame(mu, Power)

```

```{r eval = TRUE, webex.hide="Plot Solution"}
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = alpha, y = Power)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = expression(alpha), y = expression(Power~(alpha))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, color = "blue", lty = "dashed")

```


## **Question 3**

Graphically depict the power for testing \(H_0 : \mu = 2\) versus \(H_1 : \mu \neq 2\) when \(\mu_1 = 2.1\)
and \(\alpha = 0.05\) for values of \(n\) ranging from 1 to 500.

`r hide("Hint 1")`
Think about whether you are doing a one or two-tailed test and what values represent rejecting or no-rejecting them.
`r unhide()`

`r hide("Hint 2")`
First make a vector of values of \(n\).

Then you will need to find the confidence values for each \(n\) which are used to calculate the corresponding test powers.

The power values could be to be written as a data frame to make the plotting easier. 
`r unhide()`

```{r eval = TRUE, webex.hide="Calculations Solution"}
n <- 1:500
mu <- 2.1
sigma <- 0.5
alpha <- 0.05

lcv <- qnorm(alpha/2, 2, sigma/sqrt(n))
ucv <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2, 2, sigma/sqrt(n))

Power <- pnorm(lcv, mu, sigma/sqrt(n)) + pnorm(ucv, mu, sigma/sqrt(n), lower = FALSE)

DF <- data.frame(mu, Power)

```

```{r eval = TRUE, webex.hide="Plot Solution"}
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = n, y = Power)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = expression(n), y = expression(Power~(n))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, color = "blue", lty = "dashed")
```


## **Question 4**

Think about each scenario above and select the true statements below:


Statement 1 - Varying mean

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcq1 <- c("For a fixed value of n and significance level alpha, the power of a test increases as the true mean moves closer from the hypothesized mean.", "For a fixed value of n and significance level alpha, the power of a test decreases as the true mean moves farther from the hypothesized mean.", answer="For a fixed value of n and significance level alpha, the power of a test increases as the true mean moves farther from the hypothesized mean.")
```
`r longmcq(mcq1)`


Statement 2 - Varying significance level \(\alpha\)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcq2 <- c(answer = "When the sample size is fixed, the power of a test increases as the level of alpha increases", "When the sample size is fixed, the power of a test decreases as the level of alpha increases")
```
`r longmcq(mcq2)`


Statement 3 - Varying sample size \(n\)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcq3 <- c(answer = "When the  significance level of the test is fixed, the power of the test increases as the sample size increases", "When the  significance level of the test is fixed, the power of the test decreases as the sample size increases")
```
`r longmcq(mcq3)`
